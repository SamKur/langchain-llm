Shadows of the New Battlefield

In the silence before the dawn,
A low hum stirs the sky,
Glistening metal glides afar,
Where unseen pilots fly.
A world away from muddy boots,
And banners soaked in red,
Commands are issued quietly—
No words for those who've fled.

Wires flicker with electric light,
A signal, sharp and cold,
The old constraints of battle gone,
New paradigms unfold.
Satellites blinking overhead,
Relaying every breath,
In ones and zeroes, war is waged,
With algorithms of death.

Across the globe a soldier sits,
In cubicle and chair,
His screen reveals the distant lands,
He'll strike from anywhere.
No midnight march, no battle cry—
A drone is poised to fire,
Decisions made in silent rooms,
Unleashing searing ire.

Cybernetic shadows creep
Through firewalls, dark and deep.
A thousand systems compromised—
The secrets they will keep.
A virus slips across the line
And towns are quick to dark,
A digital invasion bears
An unseen, deadly mark.

Yet still, the anguish echoes on,
And mothers grieve the same,
For armored steel or subtle code
Extinguishes the flame.
The battles may be waged remote,
But loss is always near,
A silent scream within the soul—
A single, trembling tear.

Propaganda swiftly moves
On networks, fast and wide,
The truth is bent, the stories shaped
By powers that decide.
Old scars are painted over fresh,
While children learn to pray,
Their lullabies drowned out by drones
That rumble, far away.

The clash of cultures, ancient feuds,
Now fought in cryptic ways,
A meme, a leak, a whispered threat
Can set the world ablaze.
And soldiers clad in camouflage
May never see the fight,
For wars are waged with data streams
Within the endless night.

Yet hope endures where sorrow blooms
On fields once drenched in blood,
For unity may yet be found
Beneath the rising flood.
May those who hold the wires tight
Remember all the cost;
For honor, peace, and memory—
To mourn the millions lost.
