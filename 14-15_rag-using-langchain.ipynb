So if you\\'re trying to prepare for this new style of interview, forget grinding leap code and focus on building real things. Start by using AI tools like GitHub C-Pilot, Cursor or Warp to accelerate your coding workflow and work smarter. Use platforms like Replet or Versel to quickly develop full stack applications. But whatever you do, make sure to build projects that solve actual problems, not just another coding project for the sake of doing a coding project. I am tired of to-do list apps. Oh, but what if I have no idea what coding project I can do? Try this.

In winter 2025, a Colombia student named Roy Lee created a software called Interview Coder, which was specifically designed using AI to allow you to cheat in real time on technical coding interviews. And from a pure design technical standpoint, it's pretty impressive. Now, I don't condone cheating. I don't condone using it, but I do have to acknowledge when I saw the demos, my mind was boggled. So, by design, the tool sits on top of your screen, and when you feed it a screenshot of a lead code problem, it feeds it into the LLM and generates a solution for you. Think of chat GPT, but specifically designed and optimized for technical interviews. And for the user, to make sure you aren't staring at one area of the screen for too long, because that would look unnatural and suspicious, the software actually moves around to keep your eyes naturally moving, so no one can detect that you're cheating.

And he got those high-paying offers. He passed the interviews. But instead of just quietly accepting his offers, he decided to show the whole world how he did it. He made a very detailed YouTube video showing how his software cheated the Amazon coding interview. And tech companies were furious. I mean obviously Amazon, Meta, Tik Tok all rescended his offers blacklisting him and Amazon specifically asked Colombia to kick him out of the university threatening that they wouldn't hire any of the Colombia students into Amazon ever again.

       "\"The method of cheating for coding interviews involved using a software called Interview Coder, created by a student named Roy Lee. This software was designed to allow users to cheat in real time during technical coding interviews. It worked by sitting on top of the user's screen, where the user could feed it a screenshot of a coding problem. The software would then process this input using a large language model (LLM) to generate a solution.\\n\\nTo avoid detection, the software also had a feature that moved the user's eyes around the screen to make it appear natural, preventing the interviewer from noticing that the user was not genuinely solving the problem. Roy demonstrated the effectiveness of this tool by using it in his own interviews at companies like Amazon, Meta, and TikTok, where he received high-paying job offers.\""
